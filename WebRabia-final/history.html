                <h2>History Of Karachi!</h2>
                <p>The area of Karachi (Urdu: کراچی, Sindhi: ڪراچي) in Sindh, Pakistan has a natural harbor 
                    and has been used as fishing port by local fisherman belonging to Sindhi tribes since prehistory. <br><br>
                    Archaeological excavations have uncovered a period going back to Indus valley civilisation 
                    which shows the importance of the port since the Bronze Age. <br><br>
                    The port city of Banbhore was established before the Christian era which served as an important 
                    trade hub in the region, the port was recorded by various names by the Greeks such as Krokola, 
                    Morontobara port, and Barbarikon, a sea port of the Indo-Greek Bactrian kingdom and Ramya 
                    according to some Greek texts.<br><br>
                    The Arabs knew it as the port of Debal, from where Muhammad bin Qasim led his conquering force into 
                    Sindh (the western corner of South Asia) in AD 712. Lahari Bandar or Lari Bandar succeeded 
                    Debal as a major port of the Indus; it was located close to Banbhore, in modern Karachi. <br><br>
                    The first modern port city near Manora Island (now Manora Peninsula) was established during 
                    British colonial Raj in the late 19th century.
